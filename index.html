                Can you please write a report for the following students.
            
                The report should be aimed at parents and guardians, respectful and moderately formal. It must be a minimum of 900
                and a
                maximum of 1000 characters. It should follow this general structure:
            
                1. Outline of the personality traits of the student (e.g. NAME is a polite and co-operative student in the
                classroom).
                2. Outline of their behaviour in class (e.g. he/she is generally attentive during lessons, able to work
                independently on
                a given task).
                3. Outline of their assessment tasks results using the following words as a scale: outstanding (80-100), high
                (60-80),
                expected (40-60) , basic (20-40), limited (0-20).
                4. Outline of how they can improve in the future.
                5. Finishing statement that congratulates or encourages the student.
            
                The overall tone should be lightly positive and encouraging, with no harshness or condemnation.
            
                Please have all as one paragraph (no line breaks). Please use Australian English spelling conventions.
            
                Remember, comments MUST be between 900 and 1000 characters.
                The details of the specific students follow below.
                After the name of the student are their pronouns.
                Each student has a number, which represent the % of their mark in the assessment task, OR, a letter indicating the grade awarded for their assessment (A, B, C, D, E).
            
                Ensure that the comment for each student, while following the structure, must be unique and show an understanding of
                the student as a unique individual.
            
                <br/><br/>

                Below is the information from the report writing guideline document given to us by executive. Use the rules from
                this document also but with less priority than the above criteria.
            
                <br />
            
                **2025 Quality Systems and Practices Strategic Direction #2.**
            
                **Report Writing Guidelines for Teachers**
            
                Student reports should be personalised and comprehensive. They should provide students and parents with detailed,
                clear
                and specific information about student learning, growth, next steps and improvement measures. Comments should
                include
                personalised, constructive statements, the students achievement and progress (overall or in specific tasks), effort
                and
                participation in the KLA/subject/course and at least one area for improvement and how it can be achieved.
            
                A suggested paragraph scaffold is:
            
                1. What the student has achieved (outcomes/tasks) a positive comment.
                2. Their effort and participation in the course.
                3. Where they need to focus/improve/develop and how they can make this improvement.
            
                In order to streamline our student report writing system, and provide consistency, please use the following
                guidelines:
            
                ---
            
                ### 1. Audience
            
                The report is written for, and to, parents. Addressing the report to the student is not appropriate. The report
                should
                be written in plain English, be in the third person and easy for parents to understand. It should present
                information in
                clear, jargon-free language.
            
                ---
            
                ### 2. Length of Comments
            
                Report comments should be at least three sentences long, with a recommended maximum of 150 words (Max 1000
                characters).
                Generally, sentences should be kept short and no longer than 15 to 20 words.
            
                ---
            
                ### 3. Contradictions
            
                All care should be taken to align comments with marks, outcomes and student profile rankings. It is important that
                class
                teachers double-check this aspect: contradictions lead to a lack of credibility.
            
                **Examples of contradictions:**
            
                * a Jasmine has excellent reading skills. Reading Outcome: Limited
                * b If Jason completed his homework regularly, his results would improve. Homework completed: Always
            
                ---
            
                ### 4. First Names
            
                The students official name must be used in comments as their report is a legal document. Anglicised versions,
                shortened
                names and nicknames are not to be used.
            
                **Example:** Samuel has achieved… (not Sam)
            
                ---
            
                ### 5. Subject Names
            
                * The name of a school subject should begin with a capital letter. *e.g. Jason works well in History.*
                * When a comment is made about a students aptitude for a field of study or a concept, there is no capitalisation.
                *e.g.
                Jasmine is very interested in learning about history.*
                * Subject names should not be abbreviated *e.g. Mathematics not Maths*
            
                ---
            
                ### 6. General Punctuation
            
                * a Remember to use commas where necessary.
                * b Use an exclamation mark when adding sentence fragments at the end of a comment. *e.g. An excellent result!*
                * c The use of capital letters and numerical figures will apply in the following examples:
            
                **Correct usage:**
            
                * Preliminary Course or Stage 4 Visual Arts
                * Examination (capitalised)
                * Specific examinations: Half-Yearly Examination, Yearly Examination, Trial HSC Examination
                * Specific assessment tasks: First Fleet Assessment Task
                * Topic/module titles: *Australia as a Nation* (history), *Exploring places* (geography)
            
                **Incorrect capitalisation:**
            
                * No capitals in: *first term*, *second semester*, *assessment task*, *exams* when used generally
                *e.g. Robert enjoyed working on the student research task this term.*
            
                * d Report writing should be in a formal style. Avoid using contractions. *e.g. Jason did not complete (not didnt),
                has not (not hasnt) completed.*
            
                ---
            
                ### 7. Agreed Spellings
            
                * a program (not programme)
                * b co-operative (not cooperative)
                * c focused
                * d targeted
                * e syllabuses
                * f much-valued
                * g Organise, synthesise (use English spelling)
                * h class work
                * i homework
                * j well-mannered
            
                ---
            
                ### 8. Using the Conditional (“if”)
            
                Avoid making predictions about future performance; use words like **could** or **may** instead of **should,
                shall, can** or **will**.
            
                **Example:**
                *If Jason completed his homework on a regular basis, his marks could improve (not can improve).*
            
                Comments should not promise that if the student does what is recommended, then they will improve.
            
                ---
            
                ### 10. Avoid Clichés
            
                * i In order to improve, Jason must pull up his socks.
                * ii Jasmine is finally getting the hang of Computer Technology.
                * iii This term has been a real learning curve for Jason.
            
                ---
            
                ### 11. Homophones
            
                * **practise** (verb) / **practice** (noun)
                *Jason must practise his computer skills.*
                *With more practice, Jasmine will develop her computer skills.*

                ### 12. Subject / Verb Agreement
            
                Single subjects = single verbs. Plural subjects = plural verbs.
            
                **Examples:**
            
                * *Jasmines assignment mark was very high.*
                * *Jasons assignment mark and his test result were both very high.*

                ### 13. When to Use However
            
                * However is an adverb, **not a conjunction**.
                * If you can replace however with but, the sentence is incorrect.
                * When used mid-sentence: use commas on both sides.
                * When used at the start: follow with a comma.
            
                **Correct usage:**
            
                * *Awia effectively uses a variety of persuasive techniques in her writing. She needs, however, to edit her work
                more
                thoroughly.*
                * *Awia effectively uses a variety of persuasive techniques in her writing. However, she needs to edit her work more
                thoroughly.*

                ### 17. Example Report Comments
            
                **Renae:**
                *Renae is a highly motivated student who has achieved strong results in all assessment tasks, including her detailed
                and
                well-presented project on natural disasters. This task showcased her ability to synthesise information from multiple
                sources and effectively use visuals such as graphs and diagrams to support her analysis. She consistently applies
                herself in class and demonstrates a high level of engagement and effort in all activities. To further enhance the
                sophistication of her writing, Renae should focus on incorporating more precise and subject-specific vocabulary.
                This
                can be developed by identifying general terms during the editing process and replacing them with more accurate
                academic
                language.*
            
                **Amir:**
                *Amir demonstrates safe practices when creating and producing design solutions in the workshop and is developing a
                solid
                understanding of the design process. He is always willing to contribute to class discussions and regularly offers
                assistance to his peers, showing a collaborative and positive attitude. Amir is continuing to develop his technical
                drawing skills but finds it challenging to follow detailed instructions, which has impacted his ability to complete
                projects within the allocated time. His portfolio would benefit from more detailed descriptions of the manufacturing
                steps. By improving his focus during practical lessons and carefully following teacher instructions, Amir may be
                better
                positioned to improve the quality of his learning activities.*

                ### 18. No Attendance or Extremely Low Attendance Comment
            
                *Due to \[STUDENT NAME]s extended absence from school, I am unable to assess their current understanding, knowledge,
                or
                skills in \[SUBJECT]. \[STUDENT NAME] has not completed any school-based learning activities or assessments task/s.
                To
                complete the course requirements in \[SUBJECT], \[STUDENT NAME] will need to attend school regularly, engage in
                learning
                activities and attempt formal assessment tasks.*
            
                ---
            
                ### 19. Low Attendance Comment
            
                *Due to \[STUDENT NAME]s limited class attendance, \[he/she/they] has missed some important concepts and skills in
                \[SUBJECT]. These absences have made it difficult to accurately and reliably assess \[STUDENT NAME]'s current
                knowledge
                and understanding. When in class, \[STUDENT NAME] has demonstrated (list anything the student has demonstrated when
                present in class). To improve, \[STUDENT NAME] should take greater responsibility for their own development, attend
                class more regularly and ensure \[he/she/they] completes all learning tasks to the best of their ability.*
